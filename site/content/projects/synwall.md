description: A different way to think firewalling
summary: >
        SYNwall brings to you a total new way to approach firewalling: you donâ€™t have to worry anymore about rules, IP, ports, etc. A simple PSK will allow a low-maintenance firewall-like security. Built with IoT in mind, it can be used also in different environments.
